# Better Auto Mechanics

**Train mechanics with a single click. Smarter, more intuitive, and lightweight. Works in Multiplayer and Singleplayer.**

Rewritten from the ground up, **Better Auto Mechanics** is a comprehensive quality-of-life upgrade for the mechanic skill in Project Zomboid. Inspired by the original mod [AutoMechanics](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3387539308), it improves on several key features while still allowing you to train mechanics on vehicles with a single button. And it actually works in multiplayer!

## 🔧 Key Features

* **Smart XP Tracking:** The mod knows exactly when you can't gain XP from a specific car anymore. It will alert you if a vehicle isn't worth training on, so you never waste time.
* **Resume Interrupted Training:** If zombies interrupt you (or you cancel an action), you can pick up exactly where you left off. No more starting from scratch and wasting part durability!
* **Efficiency First:** The mod will never perform an action if it won't yield XP.
* **Clearer Tooltips:** Know exactly what tools you need and how your level and recipes impact the training before you start.
* **Less Confusing:** Instead of confusing options with no description, this mod has no options. It clearly communicates when you should use a disposable car and automatically avoids parts that are way too risky at lower levels.
* **Lightweight:** Its lightweight codebase makes it less likely to break with future game updates.

## 🚗 How to Use

1.  Open the mechanics window on any vehicle.
2.  Right-click any part.
3.  Select **"Train Mechanics"**.
4.  Watch the levels go up!

> **Note:** Pathfinding can sometimes impact the training session. Please ensure your character has some walking space around the car. Very rarely, pathfinding breaks and stops the training; in that case, just move a little bit and restart the training.

## ⚠️ Compatibility & Save Info
