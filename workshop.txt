description=Rewritten from the ground up, [b]Better Auto Mechanics[/b] is a comprehensive quality-of-life upgrade for the mechanic skill. Inspired by the original mod "[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3387539308]AutoMechanics[/url]", it improves on several key features while still allowing you to train mechanics on vehicles with a single button. And it actually works in multiplayer!

description=[h2]🔧 Key Features[/h2]
description=[list]
description=[*] [b]Smart XP Tracking:[/b] The mod knows exactly when you can't gain XP from a specific car anymore. It will alert you if a vehicle isn't worth training on, so you never waste time.
description=[*] [b]Resume Interrupted Training:[/b] If zombies interrupt you (or you cancel an action), you can pick up exactly where you left off. No more starting from scratch and wasting part durability!
description=[*] [b]Efficiency First:[/b] The mod will never perform an action if it won't yield XP.
description=[*] [b]Clearer Tooltips:[/b] Know exactly what tools you need and how your skill level, known recipes, and other factors impact the training before you start.
description=[*] [b]Translated into:[/b] English, German, Russian (credits to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Templarum]Kavinsky[/url]!), French, simple + trad. Chinese, Japanese, and Spanish.

description=[h2]⚙️ Mod Settings[/h2]
description=You can customize the [b]"Minimum Vehicle Part Success Chance"[/b] in the options. This value determines the safety threshold for installing/uninstalling parts; any part with a success chance below this value will be skipped during training.
description=[list]
description=[*] [b]0 (Risky):[/b] All parts will be worked on. Be careful—parts [i]will[/i] break or lose condition at lower skill levels.
description=[*] [b]30 (Default):[/b] A good balance. Parts with a very low success chance are skipped to prevent excessive damage, while still allowing for decent XP gain.
description=[*] [b]100 (Safe Mode):[/b] Only parts that are guaranteed to succeed will be worked on. This is completely safe at all skill levels, though training may be slower as fewer parts are eligible.

description=
description=[b]Multiplayer / Server Admins:[/b]
description=Server owners can enforce this setting via Sandbox Options.
description=[list]
description=[*] [b]-1 (Default):[/b] The setting is [b]not enforced[/b]. Players are free to use their own local Mod Option setting.
description=[*] [b]0 to 100:[/b] The setting is [b]enforced server-wide[/b]. Any value greater than -1 will override individual player choices. The value set by the server will be visible in the button tooltip.
